### Sentiment analysis for movie reviews

Movie reviews are crucial tools for assessing a film’s performance, overcoming the limitations of traditional numerical or star ratings. While quantitative evaluations provide a surface-level picture of a film’s success or failure, the compilation of textual reviews provides a more in-depth qualitative understanding. Textual reviews, beyond simply categorizing grades, operate as detailed narratives, revealing the intricate tapestry of a film’s strengths and shortcomings. These evaluations serve as a platform for critics and spectators to express themselves, highlighting key areas that contribute to a film’s overall impact. The data was collected using web scraping techniques and data cleaning and visualisation was done. Three different variations of Naive Bayes model were implemented in this project and were compared with each other. Out of these three models, Bernoulli’s Naive Bayes is performing the best in terms of accurate prediction of the sentiment.
